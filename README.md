# Raman-data-analysis

This repository contains Python code to efficiently read multi-paired Raman spectroscopy data from Excel sheets, normalize intensity values for direct comparison, and generate publication-quality plots of wavenumber shifts versus normalized intensity. Ideal for researchers analyzing spectral shifts and trends across multiple datasets, with easy customization for figure styling and data input formats.

Key features:

Reads alternating X (wavenumber) and Y (intensity) columns from Excel files

Normalizes intensity data across datasets for consistent comparison

Produces high-quality, large-font plots with markers and legends

Easily adaptable for similar spectroscopic or experimental data
